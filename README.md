# Tone-change
Linguistic data and code used to investigate how tones change over time

The current project consists of an acoustic analysis of the tones of Yuen Ren Chao from recordings published in 1922 (Chao 1922). 
WAV files and Praat TextGrids are deposited here.
The Praat script is used to extract f0 from the labeled intervals every 10 msec. 
The R code is used to process the f0 track data. f0 is normalized and raw time is converted to relative time. 
The code used to produce the figures that appear in the paper "Tone change in Mandarin" are deposited here.
